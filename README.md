# SAILOR

Sailor stands for:

-   S emantic
-   AI
-   L ink
-   O rganizer
-   R etriever

This is sort of a spiritual successor to [WTFDIST](https://github.com/EvanChisholm1/wtfdist) my personal search engine. Sailor uses modern semantic search techniques to hopefully achieve much better search performance. Initially I will probably do standard KNN with numpy.array in order to find documents and then I will handroll my own ANN algorithims for funsies to make it go faster.
